                  are discouraged because of difficulty describing its usage when
                  embedded in APIs. 1. Ignored fields.  It includes many fields which
                  are not generally honored.  For instance, ResourceVersion and FieldPath
                  are both very rarely valid in actual usage. 2. Invalid usage help.
                  \ It is impossible to add specific help for individual usage.  In
                  most embedded usages, there are particular restrictions like, \"must
                  refer only to types A and B\" or \"UID not honored\" or \"name must
                  be restricted\". Those cannot be well described when embedded. 3.
                  Inconsistent validation.  Because the usages are different, the
                  validation rules are different by usage, which makes it hard for
                  users to predict what will happen. 4. The fields are both imprecise
                  and overly precise.  Kind is not a precise mapping to a URL. This
                  can produce ambiguity during interpretation and require a REST mapping.
                  \ In most cases, the dependency is on the group,resource tuple and
                  the version of the actual struct is irrelevant. 5. We cannot easily
                  change it.  Because this type is embedded in many locations, updates
                  to this type will affect numerous schemas.  Don't make new APIs
                  embed an underspecified API type they do not control. \n Instead
                  of using this type, create a locally provided and used type that
                  is well-focused on your reference. For example, ServiceReferences

                      field access statement, such as desiredState.manifest.containers[2].
                      For example, if the object reference is to a container within
                      a pod, this would take on a value like: "spec.containers{name}"
                      (where "name" refers to the name of the container that triggered
                      the event) or if no container name is specified "spec.containers[2]"
